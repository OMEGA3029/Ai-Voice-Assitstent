# Ai-Voice-Assitstent
This project aims to develop a personalized AI voice assistant named Luffy, capable of understanding voice  commands, executing system-level tasks, playing YouTube videos, searching the web, sending emails, and generating responses using the Groq LLM API—all while interacting naturally using text-to-  speech and speech recognition technologies.
